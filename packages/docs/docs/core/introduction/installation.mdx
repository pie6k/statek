### With React

If you want to use state with react, you'll need both `statek` and `@statek/react` installed.

```bash npm2yarn
npm install --save statek @statek/react
```

### Without React

Statek by itself is very powerful. If you want to use it without react, call:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install --save statek
```
